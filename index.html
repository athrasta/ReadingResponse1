    <h1> The Time You Attended the E-mail Address Validation Meeting </h1> <h4>By Paul Ford</h4> 

</div>

<div class="second">
<h2>What is Code?</h2>
<br>In the interest of understanding more about how all this works, and with an open invitation from TMitTB (The man in the taupe blazer), you attend a meeting of the programmers. </p>
<br>Two of them are late, and bravely you ask the one already in attendance to explain what’s going on. He quickly gathers the limits of your information through a series of questions, beginning with, <strong>“Do you know what a Web page is?”</strong> </p>
<br>Here’s what he shows you: To gather an e-mail address and a name, you can make a Web page using HTML.  
    On today’s agenda: How to make sure that registration is a positive experience for users but also a secure experience for the company. The questions to be discussed, the programmer tells you, are along the lines of, “Where will you put this data? Will you put it in a text file? What will you do with it? How will you act upon it?” </p>
<br>“Do we need to keep track of how many times they’ve been e-mailed?” “How do we remove e-mails once they’re in the system?” “What if someone enters the same e-mail twice?” </p>
<br>Programmer A, the leader, seems very professional. She’s at the whiteboard, scribbling, erasing, scribbling, erasing. Lists, arrows, boxes, lines. She wrote RUSSIANS? on the board. But after an hour you realize: This is just e-mail. One field. One little bit of data. You haven’t even hit names yet. What if the user has one name? What if Bono or Cher signs up for an account? What if it’s the Chinese Bono? Do we want to allow sign-ups in Chinese? What browsers do we need to support? Do the call center people need to be able to manage accounts? </p>
<br>It’s hard not to think of barrels of cash burning. </p>
<br>Programmer B is entering things into a tracking system, creating issues, assigning tasks to people. A flurry of e-mailed assignments is emerging from this meeting. Programmer C is young and annoying and very programmery, but the others seem to like him well enough. </p>
<br>How do we ensure that credit cards are valid, that physical addresses are real? Will we perform financial transactions ourselves? Which external systems will integrate with our systems? Who will get the sales reports? We didn’t talk about the mailing list software. We didn’t talk about password length, the number of letters and symbols necessary for passwords to be secure, or whether our password strategy on this site will fit in with the overall security profile of the company, which is the responsibility of a different division. </p>
<br>So this is the work. It goes on for days. </p>
<br>It gets turned into specifications and user stories, then reviewed with TMitTB, who right now is away at a conference (but tells you he’s overjoyed you attended this meeting). </p>
<br>Not a line of code is written throughout this process. </p>


<h2>What Is the Relationship Between Code and Data? </h2>

<br>Data comes from everywhere. Sometimes it comes from third parties&mdash;Spotify imports big piles of music files from record labels. Sometimes data is user-created, like e-mails and tweets and Facebook posts and Word documents. Sometimes the machines themselves create data, as with a Fitbit exercise tracker or a Nest thermostat. When you work as a coder, you talk about data all the time. When you create websites, you need to get data out of a database and put them into a Web page. If you’re Twitter, tweets are data. If you’re the IRS, tax returns are data, broken into fields.</p>
<br>Data management is the problem that programming is supposed to solve.
But of course now that we have computers everywhere, we keep generating more data, which requires more programming, and so forth. It’s a hell of a problem with no end in sight. This is why people in technology make so much money. Not only do they sell infinitely reproducible nothings, but they sell so many of them that they actually have to come up with new categories of infinitely reproducible nothings just to handle what happened with the last batch. That’s how we ended up with “big data.” I’ve been to big-data conferences and they are packed.</p>

<h2>Where Does Data Live? </h2>
<br>
    It’s rare that a large task is ever very far from a database. Amazon, Google, Yahoo!, Netflix, Spotify—all have huge, powerful databases.
    The most prevalent is the relational database, using a language called SQL, for Structured Query Language. Relational databases represent the world using tables, which have rows and columns. SQL looks like this:</p>
<br>SELECT * FROM BOOKS WHERE ID = 294;</p>
<br>Implying that there’s a table called BOOKS and a row in that table, where a book resides with an ID of 294. IDs are important in databases. Imagine a bookstore database. It has a customer table that lists customers. It has a books table that lists books. And it has a clever in-between table of purchases with a row for every time a customer bought a book.</p>
<br>Congratulations! You just built Amazon! Of course, while we were trying to build a bookstore, we actually built the death of bookstores—that seems to happen a lot in the business. You set out to do something cool and end up destroying lots of things that came before.</p>
<br>Relational databases showed up in the 1970s and never left. There’s Oracle, of course. Microsoft has SQL Server; IBM has DB2. They all speak SQL and work in a similar manner, with just enough differences to make it costly to switch.</p>
<br>Oracle makes you pay thousands of dollars to use its commercial enterprise database, but more and more of the world runs on free software databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL. There’s even a tiny little database called SQLite that’s so small, so well-behaved, and so permissively licensed that it’s now in basically every smartphone, available to apps to help them save and load data. You probably have a powerful SQL-driven database in your pocket right now.</p>
<h2>The Language of White Collars</h2>
<br>If you walk up to some programmers and say, “Big corporate programming,” they’ll think of Java. Go to any of the popular coding job sites, such as dice.com, and search for openings in New York City—almost 2,000 results for Java on a recent search; 1,195 for JavaScript; 930 for Python; 344 for Ruby. Only two for Lisp.</p>
<br>Java is a programming language that was born at Sun Microsystems (R.I.P.), the product of a team led by a well-regarded programmer named James Gosling. It’s object-oriented, but it also looks a lot like C and C++, so for people who understood those languages, it was fairly easy to pick up. It was conceived in 1991, eventually floating onto the Internet on a massive cloud of marketing in 1995, proclaimed as the answer to every woe that had ever beset programmers. Java ran on every computer! Java would run right inside your Web browser, in “applets” (soon called “crapplets”), and would probably take over the Web in time. Java! It ran very slowly compared with more traditional languages such as C. What was it for? Java! They also had network-connected computer terminals called JavaStations. Java! Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers even announced a $100 million Java fund in 1996. But after all that excitement, Java sort of ... hung out for a while. The future didn’t look like Sun said it would.</p>
<br>Java running “inside” a Web browser, as a plug-in, never worked well. It was slow and clunky, and when it loaded it felt like you were teetering on the edge of disaster, a paranoia that was frequently validated when your browser froze up and crashed. Java-enabled jewelry, meant to serve as a kind of digital key/credit card/ID card, also had a low success rate. But Java was free to download and designed to be useful for small and large teams alike.</p>
<br>Here are some facts about Java to help you understand how it slowly took over the world by the sheer power of being pretty good:</p>
<ul>

<li>It was a big language. It came with a ton of code already there, the “class library,” which had all the classes and methods you’d need to talk to a database, deal with complex documents, do mathematics, and talk to various network services. There were a ton of classes in that library waiting to be turned into objects and brought to life.</li>
<li>It automatically generated documentation. This was huge. Everyone says code deserves excellent documentation and documentation truly matters, but this is a principle mostly proven in the breach. Now you could run a tool called javadoc, and it would make you Web pages that listed all the classes and methods. It was lousy documentation, but better than nothing and pretty easy to enhance if you took the time to clean up your code.</li>
<li>There were a lot of Java manuals, workshops and training seminars, and certifications. Programmers can take classes and tests to be officially certified in many technologies. Java programmers had an especially wide range to choose from.</li>
<li>It ran on a “virtual” machine, which meant that Java “ran everywhere,” which meant that you could run it on Windows, Mac, or Unix machines and it would behave the same. It was an exceptionally well-engineered compromise. Which made it perfect for big companies. As the 2000s kept going, Java became more popular for application servers. Creating a content management system for a nongovernmental organization with 2,000 employees? Java’s fine. Connecting tens of thousands of people in a company to one another? Java. Need to help one bank talk to another bank every day at 5:01 p.m.? Java. Charts and diagrams, big stacks of paper, five-year projects? Java. Not exciting, hardly wearable, but very predictable. A language for building great big things for great big places with great big teams.</li>
</ul>

<br>People complain, but it works.</p>

<h2>Briefly on the Huge Subject of Microsoft</h2>
<br>Of course if you are Microsoft, this is intolerable. You can’t have some other company creeping into your banks and enterprises with this dumb language. You can’t have people choosing to run stuff on a virtual machine when they should be running it on Windows machines, as God and Bill Gates intended.</p>
<br>Don’t ever count Microsoft out. Its great
    corporate skill has always been to take the sheer
    weirdness of computer ideas and translate them
    for corporations, in the language of Global
    Business Leadership. Whatever is discussed in
    this issue, Microsoft offers at least one of it.
    Statically typed, scripting, data-driven,
    functional—name your ambiguous adjective,
    and Microsoft will sell something that delivers
    that to you, and you can write Windows code in
    it and live a Windows life. And this is not
    disparagement; Microsoft products can be as good as or better than anything else on the market.</p>

<h2>Liquid Infrastructure</h2>
<br>“Enterprise” is a feared word among programmers, because enterprise programming is a lot of work without much to show for it. Remember healthcare.gov, the first version that was a total disaster? Perfect example of enterprise coding. At the same time, programmers respect big systems— when they work. We respect the ambition of huge heavy machines running big blobs of code. We grew up reading about supercomputers. Big iron is cool, even if the future seems to be huge cloud platforms hosting with tons of cheap computers.</p>
<br>But Java is also in wide use at Google. It’s a language for places such as General Electric and Accenture. These aren’t startups, but if their product schedules slip, so does their revenue, and they are beholden to the public markets. Gigantic data-driven organizations are structured around code, around getting software made. But that doesn’t mean their teams are huge— Amazon, for example, is famous for its two-pizza rule: “Never have a meeting where two pizzas couldn’t feed the entire group.”</p>
<br>These companies have cultures that know how to make software. They have whole departments dedicated to testing. The process is important because there are so many moving pieces, many of them invisible.</p>
<br>Academic researchers often produce things that basically work but don’t have interfaces. They need to prove their theses, publish, and move on to the next thing. People in the free software community often code to scratch an itch and release that code into the digital commons so that other people can modify and manipulate it. While more often than not this process goes nowhere, over time some projects capture the imagination of others and become part of the infrastructure of the world.</p>
<br>Java, interestingly, profits from all this. It’s designed for big
    corporate projects and has the infrastructure to support them. It’s also a useful language for midsize tasks. So the libraries that you need to do things —image processing, logging on to files, full-text search—keep appearing at a steady clip, improving on the standard libraries or supplanting them entirely.</p>
<br>Eventually, people realized that if they didn’t like the Java language, they could write other languages that compile to Java “bytecode” and run on the Java virtual machine (JVM). So there are now many languages that run on top of Java. Some are versions of well-known languages, such as Jython and JRuby. Others are totally new, like Scala, which is one of the languages that Twitter began to use when it outgrew Ruby. There’s also Clojure, which is ... a Lisp. That is, Clojure takes a much-adored computer language that was born in the 1950s, updates it for the 2010s, and gives that language the ability to reuse all the Java classes in the world.</p>
<br>Clojure was created by Rich Hickey, who decided that he wanted a new, modern version of Lisp. Lisp may be old for a language, but it’s still
    revered as a classic model for thought, like a Braun shaver or an Eames chair for the mind. Hickey worked on Clojure for many years, eventually adapting it to run on the JVM. This was a dramatic choice, because it meant that Clojure had access to the entirety of the Java class library.</p>

<br>Now you walk into the office and sit at your computer and write a little Lisp-ish code, very elegant and well-considered and trim and comfortable, but you have access to thousands and thousands of incredibly well-thought-out and totally functional free libraries that you can use to get your work done.</p>
<br>Anything Java can do, Clojure can do. And since it’s built atop the JVM, it can do it on any computer. There were already Lisp editing tools out there, and it was pretty easy to modify them for Clojure. It was joined to Java like a remora to a shark. Or more accurately, it’s a remora attached to a remora, because the JVM itself is a fake machine running inside real machines.</p>
<br>Clojure is beloved but not widely used. Perhaps it will become more popular. It shows up in interesting places. It’s used at Wal-Mart Stores to collect and manage receipt data, for example. It was ported to the world of Microsoft and runs right inside Excel. It’s the craziest thing. Take a spreadsheet. Inside the spreadsheet is some Clojure code just running away, addressing the different cells and columns. Someone made a version that compiles (well, transpiles) to JavaScript, so blam, Clojure’s running in your Web browser. Actually that version is called ClojureScript.</p>
<br>The point is that things are fluid in the world of programming, fluid in a way that other industries don’t seem to be. Languages are liquid infrastructure.You download a few programs and, whoa, suddenly you have a working Clojure environment. Which is actually the Java Runtime Environment. You grab an old PC that’s outlived its usefulness, put Linux on it, and suddenly you have a powerful Web server. Now you can participate in whole new cultures. There are meetups, gatherings, conferences, blogs, and people chatting on Twitter. And you are welcomed. They are glad for the new blood.
</p>
<br>Java was supposed to supplant C and run on smart jewelry. Now it runs application servers, hosts Lisplike languages, and is the core language of the Android operating system.It runs on billions of things. It won. C and
    C++, which it was designed to supplant, also won. A lot of things keep winning because computers keep getting more plentiful. It’s weird.
    </p>

<h2>Off the Shelf</h2>
<br>A few weeks later, when he’s in the office and in for his meeting, you ask TMitTB if there’s a way to use more off-the-shelf components, a way to buy your way out of this.</p>
<br>He makes a face. Sort of, he says, but when you’re making a system that will integrate with the systems around it and your company is a set of such systems, nothing is truly off the shelf. There are tools and packages and libraries, and if you have any wit at all you already use well-documented, free code for things such as e-mail validation, but that obviates only so much.</p>
<br>“Everything is edge cases,” he says. “Testing and edge cases.” <br></p>
<br>You come to the conclusion: The world is broken.</p>

<h2>What About JavaScript?</h2>
<br>Remember Netscape, the first huge commercial Web browser? In 1995, as Java was blooming, Netscape was resolving a problem. It displayed Web pages that were not very lively. You could have a nice cartoon of a monkey on the Web page, but there was no way to make the monkey dance when you moved over it with your mouse. Figuring out how to make that happen was the job of a language developer named Brendan Eich. He sat down and in a few weeks created a language called JavaScript.</p>
<br>JavaScript’s relationship with Java is tenuous; the strongest bond between the languages is the marketing linkage of their names. And the early history of JavaScript was uninspiring. So the monkey could now dance. You could do things to the cursor, make things blink when a mouse touched them.</p>
<br>But as browsers proliferated and the Web grew from a document- delivery platform into a software-delivery platform, JavaScript became, arguably, the most widely deployed language runtime in the world. If you wrote some JavaScript code, you could run it wherever the Web was—everywhere.</p>
<br>JavaScript puttered around for years in the wilderness, as Java did, too. But without the resolute support of a corporate entity like Sun.</p>
<br> Then, about a decade ago people began to talk about Ajax ■ 29 —the idea that you could build real software into a Web page, not just a document, but a program that could do real work.</p>
<br>Things could respond and change according to inputs. You could distribute your software to hundreds of millions of people this way, and JavaScript would work for them. It wasn’t as controlled as Java, it was much slower than natively compiled C, and it had a terrible lack of niceties. And yet: Gmail, Google Maps, Flickr, Twitter, and Facebook. Every single pixel on a Web page can be manipulated now; the type can be changed, the words can move around; buttons can be pressed.</p>
<br>As with any celebrity, there’s a whole industry dedicated to spackling up its deficiencies and making it look good. There are books about the “good parts” of JavaScript; there are libraries that make it easier and more consistent to

 program, too, such as jQuery, which can turn the many lines of code necessary to make a paragraph disappear into a single $("p.optional").hide();.</p>

<br>Back in the era of the iPod and candy-colored Macintoshes, Apple took the code of an open-source Web browser called Konqueror and modified it to create Safari, its own Web browser to compete with Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. Then in 2008 Google started to make its own modifications to the Web engine underneath Safari, called Webkit, and made its own version called Chrome with a ​spanking-fast JavaScript engine called V8. They made JavaScript fast. “Devs still approach performance of JS code as if they are riding a horse cart,” tweeted one developer, “but the horse had long been replaced with fusion reactor.” Google does better when JavaScript is fast.</p>
<br>In 2009 a developer named Ryan Dahl modified the V8 engine, which was free software, and made it run outside the browser. There had been
    freestanding versions of JavaScript before (including some that ran inside Java, natch), but none so fast. He called this further fork Node.js, and it just took off. One day, JavaScript ran inside Web pages. Then it broke out of its browser prison. Now it could operate anywhere. It could touch your hard drive, send e-mail, erase all your files. It was a real programming language now. And the client ... had become the server.</p>
<br>
    In a great and sudden wave, thousands of developers began to use Node.js and create modular libraries. If you knew how JavaScript worked on a Web page, then you could make it work on a server. And a few interesting characteristics of the language made it good for writing software that
    handles lots of simultaneous users. JavaScript listened for lots of things at once in a Web browser: A mouse moves; a key is typed; some information comes in from the network. On a server it could listen to dozens or hundreds of people all at once and give them the information they requested.</p>
<br>Soon the community developed a huge library of packages—bits of software that do specific things, such as reading files, or chattering with databases, or talking to Amazon’s Web services tools. At this writing, npmjs.com has 150,000 packages, and more than a billion copies of various packages have been downloaded in the past month.</p>
<br>NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It’s software that helps you install packages and ... well, it’s unwieldy, honestly, because many of those 150,000 packages are just not that great. It’s a lot of searching and testing and sighing. But when you have this much stuff to pick from, for free, you shouldn’t complain. JavaScript is a hodgepodge designed in a hurry,
    and it runs on, well, who knows, but let’s say a billion-plus devices, so you might as well get with the program. Your customers may not have iPhones, but they probably have some way of running JavaScript.</p>
<br>So you might use JavaScript to make a more interesting Web page. You might use it to make the client-side of a full-fledged application, like Google Docs, that runs in the browser. You might use it to make a Web server that talks to a Web browser. Or you might use it to make an API that serves up data to
    a “client,” and sure, that client could be a laptop Web browser. But it’s 2015, and that client is quite probably an app on a smartphone.</p>

<h2>What’s the Absolute Minimum I Must Know About PHP?</h2>
<br>You can get a site up and running in PHP in a few minutes, and that’s the problem. It used to be the terrible choice you made when you needed to get something done on the Web, but increasingly JavaScript has replaced it as the default terrible choice.</p>
<br>PHP stands for Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter. The idea was that
    when you loaded your Web pages, the PHP code would run before the page went out to the Internet. And PHP could, say, check whether you were logged in. If you were, it could show you your top secret account details; and if you weren’t, it could say, “Please log in.”</p>
<br>I know a lot of people who program in PHP, and they are smart, good people. PHP powers Etsy and Facebook. It powers Wikipedia, for God’s sake. WordPress. Out of all the Web’s pages, an enormous percentage is created with PHP.</p>

<h3>Reading Response</h3>
    <br> What I found most striking about this chapter is the way the author speaks about various programming languages—almost ascribing different personalities to the types of programming. Javascript is for “corporate” programmers, Ford writes that it is “slow and clunky,” it is an unexciting language but reliable. Ford likens Lisp to an Eames chair: it is a classic model but still revered. Clojure is beloved but not widely used. Ford seems to like PHP the least; the “poor, sad misbegotten, incredibly effective, massively successful PHP. Reading PHP code is like reading poetry, the poetry you wrote your freshman year of college. </p>
<br>But in order to understand this section of the article, one must first understand exactly what a programming language is. As Ramsey Nasser writes in Increment: </p>
<ul><li>A programming language is a formal language used to communicate instructions to a computer. It is formal in that it conforms to a rigid set of rules that determine what is and is not allowed. It is a means of communication in that the primary goal of the tool is to translate ideas in a programmer’s head into a form that a computer can act on. The fact that you are communicating with a computer is significant. Unlike other forms of language, or even instructional arts like musical composition or screenwriting, the final agent fulfilling the instructions is not human. The result is that qualities that other forms of communication tend to depend on—like intuition, common sense, and context—are not available.
</li></ul>

<h3>Java </h3>

<br>As Ford mentions earlier in the article, there are about 700 programming languages. In this section, Ford mostly talks about the pros and cons of Java. It is the programming language of the corporate world and it is used by companies like Google. It has slowly taken “over the world by the sheer power of being pretty good. Another interesting thing Ford discusses in this section is that people can write other languages that comply with Java. Thus, there are many well-known languages like Jython and JRudy that run on top of Java. Ford emphasizes that things are “fluid” in the world of programming. He says that languages work like liquid infrastructure. 
</p>

<h3>JavaScript </h3>

<br>JavaScript has become a very popular programming language. It began when Bredan Eich wanted to figure out how to make items move on a webpage. Ford writes that there were many interesting characteristics of the language that made it good for writing that handles lots of simultaneous users. JavaScript listened for many things at once in a web browser: a mouse moves, a key is typed; some information comes in from the network. 
</p>

<h3>Programming Language History </h3>
<br>
In an effort to understand how these programming languages were develop, I looked into the history of various programming languages. Omar Rizwan published a list on the various programming languages that been developed in the past few decades: 
</p>
<ul>

<h3> 1980s</h3>
<li> Common Lisp:attempt to unify various Lisp dialects; settles on lexical variable scope as in Scheme; Common Lisp and Scheme become the two major Lisp families</li>
<li>PostScript: Adobe’s page description language; stack-based, so all data lives on stacks; used by printers and in graphics tools; pioneering vector graphics model</li>
<li>1972—C++: originally “C with Classes”; adds low-cost abstractions to C for generic programming and object-oriented programming</li>

<li>Erlang: language for concurrent and fault-tolerant software, built out of many lightweight processes; used in telecommunications</li>
 <li>Objective-C: adds Smalltalk-style object-oriented programming with message passing to C; would be adopted by NeXT and then Apple for Mac and iOS</li>
<li>Perl: general-purpose scripting language with powerful string manipulation tools</li>
<li>Tcl: simple, embeddable scripting language for “gluing” larger components together</li>

<h3>1990s</h3>

<li>Haskell: research language for lazy functional programming with static types</li>
<li>1991—Python: scripting language in similar niche to Perl; clean design, whitespace syntax, and list comprehensions</li>
    
<li>Visual Basic: BASIC descendant with drag-and-drop interface for making GUIs; integrated development environment</li>
<li>PHP: begins as preprocessor for embedded code in web pages; becomes a way to build dynamic web applications</li>
<li>1995—Java: object-oriented programming language with automatic memory management; combination of ideas from C++ and Smalltalk; originally meant for the web, but grows to dominate enterprise software </li>
<li>JavaScript: the web frontend programming language; Scheme-like semantics underneath Java-like syntax</li>
 <li>Ruby: scripting language; humanizes metaprogramming concepts from Smalltalk and Lisp; would become popular for web programming in the 2000s</li>

<h3>2000s</h3>
<li>C#: object-oriented language, originally similar to Java; part of Microsoft’s then-new .NET framework</li>
<li>Scala: statically typed functional programming language; runs on Java virtual machine and interoperates with Java, but supports functional programming and has more expressive types in ML tradition</li>
<li>Clojure: Lisp variant that interoperates with Java; like most Lisps, dynamically typed; emphasizes functional programming and immutable data</li>
 <li>Go: developed at Google for “large systems”; simple static types, built-in concurrency, garbage collection, and fast compilation</li>

 <h3>2010s</h3>
<li>Rust: systems programming language; meant to compete with C++ for low-level and high-performance software, while improving safety and concurrency; multi-paradigm (object-oriented, functional, and procedural features) </li>
<li>Swift: multi-paradigm Apple language for iOS and Mac development and more; safer and more expressive type system than Objective-C, drawing ideas from languages like Haskell and C#</li>

</ul>
